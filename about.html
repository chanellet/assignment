    <h1> About me</h1>
    <p><span>I'm a Dispensary Technician who has been in the Pharmacy section for well over 13 years. I had a passion for medicine, helping others and ensuring I could give the best possible advice to better someone's life. Nowadays that passion has dwindled and I've found myself back in the realm of technology, admiring what code can bring to life. I aspire to work in Web Development and hopefully bring fun, intuitive designs to the online world.

I am currently learning HTML and CSS but have dabbled in a bit of Python. As a student at Coder Academy I'm hoping to come out with a lot more coding knowledge than I previously had and find a job in the tech industry.

In my spare time you can find me curled up with a good romantasy or epic fantasy book, streaming on Twitch to connect with fellow gamers, playing MMORPGs or simply having a a nap with my cat, Coco.</span></p>
